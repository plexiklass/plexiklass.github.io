            <p>Plexi-Klass Manufacturing has been in the plastics business for over 20 years. We are a full service shop offering product design, proto-typing, production runs, and material sales. We pride ourselves in offering our customers quality products that fill their need and budget, from the simple card stand to the high end one of design.</p>
            <p>Vic Summerfeldt, the owner of Plexi-Klass Manufacturing was 15 years old when he first sought employment in the plastics industry. In 1984, he opened his own company with $1000.00, the use of a friend’s garage and a couple of small contracts.
            Since then, the company’s client base has steadily expanded, and with it, established a reputation as craftsmen and solid partner in the region’s local market.</p>
            <p>Vic explains about his company in more detail: “We provide a range of services, including design and production of custom plastics fabricated products.”</p>
            <p>“Our company mandate is to give clients our “commitment to excellence”, through innovative design, excellent workmanship, and on time delivery. We are dedicated to providing a quality product, that fits within the clients needs and budget.”</p>
            <p>“We are a small company that takes pride in what we do and like to be seen as the little engine that could.”</p>
